# Parameterized knobs for hexagonal screws and nuts

Allows to create hand operated star shaped knobs for hexagonal screws and nuts.
The output is widely configurable, see the comments in the `scad` file for details.

## 3D printing
* layer height: 0.2mm
* infill: 50%
* support: yes for knobs with hubs, no otherwise

I usually print the knobs with hubs upside down and sand the top surface with 120 grit, 240 grit, and 360 grit sand paper.
